> **distributed systems** is a set of cooperating computers that communicate with eachother over a network to get some task done

if it's possible to solve a problem with 1 computer, without building a distributed system, then do that way

why use/build a distributed system?

- parallelism
- fault tolerance
- physical reasons
- security/isolation

the course will focus on the first 2 points

why ds is hard?

- concurrency
- network interations (partial failure)
- performance

the infrastructure/systems course coverage is: 

- **storage**
- computation
- communication

the critical tools to build a ds are:

- RPC (to mask/abstract the network)
- threads
- concurrency locks etc...

## Performance things

- <ins>Scalability</ins>\
**|** 2x computers -> 2x performance/throughput\
**|** huge win business side, you just buy more computers and don't pay programmers to optimize the software
- <ins>Fault tolerance</ins>\
**|** 1000 computers =~ 3 computer failures per day\
**|** the 'behaviour' of masking a failure needs to be built in the design\
**|** implemented with replicas
- <ins>Availability</ins>\
**|** the system is operating/available despite the failure
- <ins>Recoverability</ins>\
**|** recover from a failure without any loss of correctness\
**|** save the latest state in a Non-Volatile storage so it could be used to restore after the failure, but it's expensive
