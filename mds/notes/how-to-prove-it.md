# Introduction and Cap: 1.1, 1.2

**Deductive reasoning** is the main focus of this book and in math is presented by the form of proof

> you deduce the conclusions based on something given

**conjectures** are guesses that needs to be proven by proofs

if a **counterexample** is found, then the conjecture is for sure false

**premises** leads us to **conclusions**

if both premises are true, the conclusion is also true

an **argument is valid** if the conclusion is true and that means that premises needs to be true as well

an example of invalid argument is if the conclusion could be false even if both permises are true

introduction to **sentential logic**, **and, or, not** and **truth tables**
