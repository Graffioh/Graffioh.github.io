# 39 days of leetcode

It's been 39 days :')

# What's the purpose?

My main goal is to land an internship at a big tech company, learn from experienced engineers, and work on large systems to gain real world experience with distributed systems (a topic that I really like other than money $$$).

# My previous experience

- Weak math reasoning/knowledge
- Completed a DSA course in university
- "Solved" 30~ leetcode problems last year (by copy-pasting solutions)

lmao, I had quite a few skill gaps.

# The starting plan

I started this journey on July 29 2024.

By August 18 2024, I paused my university studies to focus on leetcode full-time.

I noticed that getting into Meta wasn't too difficult, as they typically ask questions from their top 75 problems list. So, I decided to grind that list for short time profit, if we want to call it like that.
I adopted a BFS approach to absorb as much information as quickly as possible since the recruitment wave was approaching.

I created this [repository](https://github.com/Graffioh/bertos-inferno), where I documented the problems I *prentended* to solve (more on this word later) and explained the solutions in my own words.
I spent about 30-40 minutes trying to solve each problem, then reviewed the solution and worked to understand it.
With the help of [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net) for spaced repetition, this helped me learn patterns and memorize problem-solving intuitions.

# The flaw

Meta likely won’t be opening internships here in Europe.

After reading [this](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/98621), I realized that while I was prepared for a Meta interview (with 60 memorized solutions/intuitions), I was **pretending** to do the actual work.
For each problem, after 15 minutes, I'd think: "Well, I’m not good enough to solve this, so I’ll just look at the solution anyway," and I'd go ahead and do it.

Yes, I was learning new solutions and patterns, but it was all fast mapping. I wasn’t improving my slow problem-solving skills. If you're curious about this concept, check out [Colin Galen video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1f6N2UrCK6o&list=PLDjGkpToBsYDIFOfF13ojutAkCODac9u5&index=2).

# What am I doing now?

- I started reading [How to Prove It](https://users.metu.edu.tr/home205/serge/wwwhome/courses/111-2011/textbook-math111.pdf), a really accessible book that teaches math reasoning and how proofs work.
  
- I'm working through [neetcode 150](https://neetcode.io/roadmap), solving each problem by category, using a DFS approach—focusing on one topic at a time.

Now, I make a genuine effort to solve problems for 30 minutes. If I see no improvement, I look at the solution. Otherwise, I push a bit more, up to 1 hour.

This approach is actually working well, even though I started a little late (I messed up my Amazon OA), but that’s okay. We learn from failures.

# What are my future plans?

I need to resume my university studies. I have only 4 exams left (and the thesis) until graduation.
I'll balance my study time between university and leetcode.
I'll still aim to get an offer before December. If not, it’ll be too late, so I’ll keep grinding leetcode consistently, even if it’s just 1-2 hours a day. 

> Take action now, not later.
