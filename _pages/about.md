I'm Umberto, ~~19~~ 20 years old from Italy, Computer Science student.

With this blog I want to do a sort of journal through my journey in <s>game hacking</s> the CS field, sharing my personal thoughts and technical knowledge.

**(FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSE ONLY!)**

I've never wrote a blog before or documented anything online, this is my first time.

I hope you enjoy. If you want updates/suggest anything, you can DM me on Twitter or Discord.
