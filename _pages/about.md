I'm Umberto, 19 years old from Italy, Computer Science student and passionate about Reverse engineering.

With this blog I want to do a sort of journal through my journey about game hacking.

**(FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSE ONLY!)**

I've never wrote a blog before or documented anything online, so this is my first time.

I hope you enjoy. If you want updates/suggest anything, you can go on my Twitter: [@graffioh](https://twitter.com/graffioh).
