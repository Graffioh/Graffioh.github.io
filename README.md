I created this blog to document my journey in game hacking and reverse engineering,the goal was to learn how anti-cheat works and how to develop it, to protect the games that I played for a very long time.

The focus of this blog is shifted towards my personal career in the Computer Science field, sharing personal thoughts and technical knowledge.

Created using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [al_folio](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio).
