# REwithGraffioh
A blog about my journey in game hacking and reverse engineering,the goal is to learn how anti-cheat works and how to develop it, to protect the games that I played for a very long time.

The focus of the reverse part is on the FPS genre, but I'm open to learn every genre.
I don't know the frequency of the publications, I will try to keep it updated.
