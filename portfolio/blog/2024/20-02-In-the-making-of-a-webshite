# In the making of a webshite

## General overview

**Disclaimer**: the goal of this assignment was to provide a good quality software documentation rather than a good quality software.

The assignment was about an auction app, requested by some clients, with specific features, such as: login via credentials and socials, social profile, insert and view auctions of various types (fixed time, english, descending) with images, and notifications.

The frontend can be a mobile application, desktop application, or website.
As for the backend, we have a choice, but with one requirement: we should have used an object-oriented programming language.

## Choices

The choice was a website.

### Frontend

Among all the frameworks, the interest was in learning something useful for the job market, so React was chosen.

After going through the 'Getting Started' section of the React website, we found out that they suggested using another framework instead of the basic Create React App (CRA), yay  more abstraction!! So [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) was chosen as it was the most popular option, even though it's more of a product than a web framework nowadays.

For styling [TailwindCSS](https://taialwindcss.com), because it's cool.

### Backend

As for the backend, [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) was chosen because Java is the enterprise king, and we all love Java...

## The starting point

We started prototyping the frontend using Figma and the [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com) design components template. There was no struggle with Figma so far because I had already used it during my time at the Apple Developer Academy, so it wasn't a big issue.

After creating acceptable screen prototypes, everything was transposed to the Next.js frontend. Approximately a month and a half was spent on creating the frontend, learning React/Next.js, website best practices and completing other exams, after which the frontend was ready.

Of course, the website was chosen also because it's portable; the browser can be accessed everywhere. For a good website, there needs to be a mobile-optimized version as well, and thanks to TailwindCSS, it wasn't a big problem.

Now it's time for the backend!
