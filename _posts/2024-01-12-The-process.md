## "The process"
> A process is a series of steps or actions that are taken in order to achieve a particular result or goal 

Why am I talking about process in general? A process based on that definition is something that <u>*for sure*</u> will make you achieve a goal, right? Well, it depends, I will explain why bu talking about "the process" related to personal improvement.

...

## My experience
I first encountered this word when I was at the Apple Developer Academy. They always emphasized the importance of it, saying almost on every occasion: “trust the process”.

At first, I didn’t give much meaning to this phrase, but as time passed, it started to make more sense.
It’s not a straightforward discovery; you will understand it at the right time. For me, it was when I realized that I could learn anything by trusting the process and doing the work.

Why is doing the work in bold? Because “trust the process” doesn’t mean “just wait and you will achieve whatever you want”. Instead, it means “work hard and you will almost certainly achieve whatever you want” (at least based on my interpretation). Now, it’s my mantra.

Do I need to learn a new programming concept? A new programming language? A new math concept (hardcore challenge)? No problem. I’ll put in the work and trust the process. But why am I so sure and confident? Because I’ve experimented with it and found that it works...almost certainly.

Twitter post made some weeks ago related to that:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr" data-theme="dark">still can’t realize how much i improved during this year, unbelievable.</p>&mdash; bertø (@graffioh) <a href="https://twitter.com/graffioh/status/1738992218797486248?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 24, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

## Trust the process even if "it works...almost certainly"
Of course, there’s always a little probability that it won’t work, but we like risks, right? Otherwise, it’s useless to aim for great things.

...

If you have something great to aim for, don't trash it because your sorrounding say it so, instead you need to be motivated by it, you need to prove them wrong, but most importantly **yourself** wrong.
